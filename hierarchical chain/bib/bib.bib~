As the dimension is lowered from d = 4 we first observe the appearance of the Ising scaling solution and successively the appearance of multi-critical scaling solutions of arbitrary order. Approaching d = 2 these multi-critical scaling solutions converge to the unitary minimal models found in conformal field theory.}

  abstract={The behaviour of a d -dimensional vectorial N =3 model at a m -axial Lifshitz critical point is investigated by means of a nonperturbative renormalization group approach that is free of the huge technical difficulties that plague the perturbative approaches and limit their computations to the lowest orders. In particular being systematically improvable, our approach allows us to control the convergence of successive approximations and thus to get reliable physical quantities in d =3.}
